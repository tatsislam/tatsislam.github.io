<ol>
  <li>Define the website purpose (7 lines)</li>
  <li>Identify the users of the website (Stakeholder)</li>
  <li>List the tasks that they are trying to achiece.</li>
  <li>chose two tasks and try to complete those tasks</li>
  <li>During performing the tasks analuze the interface and list all the issues in a table for each type of analysis</li>
  <li>Choose 8 issues and analyse them in detail</li>
  <li>Analyse the website from the accessivility perspective.</li>
  <li>Cite your claims and add references (annotated screeenshots)</li>
  <li>You should also take screenshots and point out specific freatures on the sketches by annotating the sketches.</li>
</ol>

<p>A HD report would have at least 20 issues across the issue tables and an in depth discussion of 8 issues
The issue tables should be structured like this:</p>

<p>Consider a blind or visually impaired computer user. What sort of support do you think they would need when using a computer with a graphcial user interface.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Screen reader</li>
  <li>Zoom</li>
  <li>Voice recognition</li>
  <li>Alt text</li>
  <li>Invert colour / Brightness
Some websites give reports on accessibility, you can refer to those reports in your report</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here we will define the purpose of the website in general terms. But also we will also strictly define THREE goals of the website.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) website aims to provide a range of information on dangerous fires taking place across NSW. This information includes current danger warnings, guides on planning and preparing for fires, volunteering opportunities, media releases and other information.</p>

<p>While there are numerous goals that a user may have when accessing the RFS website, there are three important and useful services that users are aiming to access:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Checking to see if there are fires or warnings near their home</li>
  <li>Advice on what to do in the event of a fire emergency</li>
  <li>Blah</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="users-025-page"><strong>Users</strong> (0.25 page)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here we will give FIVE examples of different types of people that would use this website, giving a short description of each of these stakeholders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While there are countless categories of people accessing and using the RFS website this report will recognise five types of users:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People in areas in danger of bushfires</li>
  <li>People who are preparing for fire danger</li>
  <li>People who wish to volunteer for the RFS</li>
  <li>Journalists who are reporting on fires</li>
  <li>Fuck knows</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tasks-05-page"><strong>Tasks</strong> (0.5 page)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using TWO users that you have come up with, analyse what each of those people are trying to accomplish when they use the site.</p>
